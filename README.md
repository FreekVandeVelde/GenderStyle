# GenderStyle
Measuring stylistic complexity over time, by gender

This project measures the changing stylistic complexity over time by gender in 120 years of Dutch periodicals (1880-1990), extracted from the Dutch CCLAMP corpus (Piersoul, Jozefien, Robbert De Troij & Freek Van de Velde. 2021. ‘150 years of written Dutch: the construction of the Dutch Corpus of Contemporary and Late Modern Periodicals’. Nederlandse Taalkunde 26(3): 339-362). We make our R code and dataset publicly available.

There are three files:

"GenderStyle.R" This is the R Code

"gender_dataset_18801999.csv" This is the dataset

"TTR_gender.csv" Type-token ratio (extra variable, see analysis)
